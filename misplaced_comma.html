<h2><u>A Misplaced Comma</u></h2>
<h3>August 2018</h3><br>
<p align='left'><i>"A field where your entire day can be ruined by a misplaced comma.”</i> <br><br>A better description of programming has yet to be found. Yet there’s something alluring in the possibility that this failure in your logic may be a fundamental misunderstanding . . . or just a clumsy finger.<br><br>
The point of programming, of course, is much larger. Space race, facial recognition, predicting the future, artificial intelligence — the world of science fiction abounds with ideas that stretch the limits of believability. Ultimately futile attempts by mankind to capture the intricacies of how our brains function, how they identify and combine patterns and relate to one another, and to force various hunks of metal to do the same.<br><br>
What is a program after all? It is a series of steps, so explicit it could be told to a baby. Well not a baby — they have a human mind, and therefore a human’s computation power. The proverbial rubber duck then, that childhood memento all beginner programmers are told to translate their thoughts to.<br><br>
We all know that learning French or Mandarin gives you access to a world that plain old English wouldn’t. Although we are all human there are a million different ways to live and to experience that life, and over 6500 ways people have attempted to put labels on it. When communication is garbled due to two people not speaking the same language the resulting misunderstanding is referred to as being “lost in translation”. Even though we have not, as a species, perfected the art of communicating with each other, we have moved on ahead to the next great adventure. Like Frankenstein, programmers believe that they can instill knowledge about the world at large and directions for how to behave on to their own creation.<br><br>
Programming languages let a human teach a machine to think how a human would, but better, faster, on a grander scale. What could be more exotic than that? What could be more eye-opening?<br><br>
And perhaps that is why it is only fitting that this kingdom can often crumble on that most human of errors — a typo.</p></p>
