<h1>Natasha Mathur</h1>
<h4>Some things I'm passionate about:<br>tackling thorny data problems, public health, progressive politics, finding my next favorite book</h4>
<p>Currently, I'm the data director at <a href="https://maishameds.org/">Maisha Meds</a>, helping improve access to healthcare in several African countries. 
<p>I started off my career in politics as a Data Scientist on Elizabeth Warren's presidential campaign, which I joined in July 2019.</p>

<p>Later on, I joined the Biden campaign as a Senior Analytics Engineer focusing on <a href="https://twitter.com/AmyEGardner/status/1346191357925326850?s=20">early vote data</a>, <br>and stayed on to lead early vote data engineering for the Georgia runoff Senate races.</p>

<p>Afterwards, I worked at <a href="https://www.precisionstrategies.com/team/natasha-mathur/">Precison Strategies</a>, helping political and non-profit organizations get the most out of the their data and technology.</p>
<p>I entered the campaign world straight off of a <a href="https://harris.uchicago.edu/academics/degrees/ms-computational-analysis-public-policy-mscapp">Masters in Computational Analysis and Public Policy</a> from UChicago, and got my undergraduate degree at <a href="https://www.stern.nyu.edu/">NYU</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through it all, I like to stay connected to the broader community.<br><br>
 
   After the 2020 election, I presented at the <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/">DataForProgress<a> data engineering open mic about the 
   <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13-qsVM5JwTq63w3dC9PwLPUbhPG6-Q_qPxP0_vcUSI4/edit?usp=sharing">early vote and ballot cure engineering</a> pipelines used in the general and runoff election,<br> and about <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iT62G7WFpuvLxEDBoC89SmcN3-yV06jqMo7vi5t_TMA/edit?usp=sharing">leveraging Twitter data</a> on campaigns. <br> 
   <br>More recently I've spoken on alumni panels at <a href"https://harris.uchicago.edu/news-events/news/natasha-mathur-mscapp19-connection-between-real-world-and-data">UChicago</a> and NYU, including for a club that was very influential for me in college, <a href="https://www.uswib.com/">USWIB</a>. I also spoke about the role startups play in the public health space at the <a href=" 2024 Africa Health Conference at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health: "Health startups made in Africa: How can entrepreneurs fill in public health gaps?">2024 Africa Health Conference at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health</a>
