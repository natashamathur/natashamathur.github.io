<h1>Natasha Mathur</h1>
<h4>Some things I'm passionate about:<br>tackling thorny data problems, progressive politics, finding my next favorite book</h4>
<p>Currently, I'm a Principal (Data Science) at <a href="https://www.precisionstrategies.com">Precison Strategies</a>, working with political and non-political organizations <br> to get the most out of the data and the technology they have access to.
<p>I got my start in politics as a Data Scientist on Elizabeth Warren's presidential campaign, which I joined in July 2019.</p>

<p>Later on, I joined the Biden campaign as a Senior Analytics Engineer focusing on <a href="https://twitter.com/AmyEGardner/status/1346191357925326850?s=20">early vote data</a>, <br>and stayed on to lead early vote data engineering for the Georgia runoff Senate races.</p>

<p>I entered the campaign world straight off of a <a href="https://harris.uchicago.edu/academics/degrees/ms-computational-analysis-public-policy-mscapp">Masters in Computational Analysis and Public Policy</a> from UChicago, and got my undergraduate degree at <a href="https://www.stern.nyu.edu/">NYU</a>.</p>
<p>Through it all, I like to stay connected to the broader community.<br><br>
   After the Warren campaign, I gave a career talk at the Shishu Bharati of Nashua, focusing on the roles Indian-Americans can and do play in the world of politics. <br>
   In the summer of 2020, I contributed to the <a href="https://github.com/move-coop/parsons/pull/366/files">Parson's wrapper for the Rock the Vote API<a> 
   to include all the ways we were using their data to track voter registrations.<br>
   This past year I've spoken at the <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/">DataForProgress<a> data engineering open mic about the 
   <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13-qsVM5JwTq63w3dC9PwLPUbhPG6-Q_qPxP0_vcUSI4/edit?usp=sharing">early vote and ballot cure engineering</a> pipelines used in the general and runoff election,<br> and about <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iT62G7WFpuvLxEDBoC89SmcN3-yV06jqMo7vi5t_TMA/edit?usp=sharing">leveraging Twitter data</a> on campaigns. 
   <br>More recently, I've been a mentor with <a href="https://www.kodewithklossy.com/">Kode with Klossy</a>, and volunteer as an SAT tutor at a local high school.
