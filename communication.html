<h2 style="font-size:20px">Thoughts on Communication Best Practices</h2>
  <p>Key principles:

1. Nothing should exist only in someone's head
2. Things only get done if it they have a deadline and are [assigned to someone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect).
3. Meetings without an agenda - either internally or client facing - should probably be illegal.

The best system is the one that you and your team will use. 

This could be Notion status boards, a running Google doc, Slack, carrier pigeons . . . you do you. 

Questions to answer before starting any project

- Who are the major stakeholders in this project? How will you communicate with them?
- Where will you be keeping notes you take throughout meetings and the project?
- Decide what your schedule to review the Status Tracking Board on a regular basis will be. At this time you will look over the board, and decide whether to take actions on any items in the "In Progress" or "Blocked" columns. If they're humming along, that's great, but if not send out reminders or check out how any blockers could be worked around.
- What's the meeting schedule going to be? One 30-minute touch base with key stakeholders and one 1 hour working session with the larger team often work well.

Tips & Tricks

- Just as no meeting should exist without an agenda, no meeting should end without concrete takeaways and a plan to accomplish them. Take a few minutes after each meeting to send out a quick recap, provide a list of requests to the client, and add new items for the team to do to the Status Tracking Board.
- Follow up with people. Say thanks, emoji react, let them know what the next steps are, say you're happy to help at a later date even if it's something they have to discuss internally first - make sure everyone is kept in the loop and feels that way. Everyone should feel and be heard.
