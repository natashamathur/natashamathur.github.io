<h1><u>Best Practices for Team Communication</u></h1><br>
<div> 
  <h2><u>Key principles:</u></h2>

1. Nothing should exist only in someone's head<br>
<br>
2. Things only get done if it they have a deadline and are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect">assigned to someone</a>.<br><br>
3. Meetings without an agenda - either internally or client facing - should probably be illegal.<br><br>

<p>The best system is the one that you and your team will use. </p>

<p>This could be Notion status boards, a running Google doc, Slack, carrier pigeons . . . you do you.</p><br> </div>

 <h2><u>Tips and Tricks</u></h2>
<ul align = 'left'>
 <li> Just as no meeting should exist without an agenda, no meeting should end without concrete takeaways and a plan to accomplish them. <br> Take a few minutes after each meeting to send out a quick recap, provide a list of requests to the client, and record new items for the team to do. </li><br>
<li>If you have a list of requests, follow up on which ones have and haven't been completed at least once between when you ask and when you need to have them all fulfilled by.</li><br>
<li> Keep in touch with people. Say thanks, emoji react, let them know what the next steps are - make sure everyone is kept in the loop and feels that way. Everyone should feel and be heard.<br> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory">Encourage and support actions that you want to promote.</a></li><br>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_of_least_resistance">Make things as easy and intuitive as possible.</a><br>Remove all possible barriers to entry when it comes to using selected tools, documents, and methods. The clearer and more integrated a next step is, the more likely it is to actually be followed.</li>
</ul>
